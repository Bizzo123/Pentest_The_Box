Try to identify the services running on the server above, and then try to search to find public exploits to exploit them. Once you do, try to get the content of the '/flag.txt' file. (note: the web server may take a few seconds to start)
Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our Nmap scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like SSH or ftp.
